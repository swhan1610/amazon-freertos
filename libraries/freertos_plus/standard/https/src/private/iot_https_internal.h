/**
 * @brief The state of the HTTP response parsing. 
 * 
 * This state notes what has been parsed in the HTTP response.
 * 
 * The states move as follows:
 * PARSER_STATE_NONE --> PARSER_STATE_IN_HEADERS --> PARSER_STATE_HEADERS_COMPLETE --> PARSER_STATE_BODY_COMPLETE
 * 
 * The parser callbacks are called in the following order:
 * 1. _httpParserOnMessageBeginCallback()
 * 2. _httpParserOnStatusCallback()
 * 3. _httpParserOnHeaderFieldCallback()
 * 4. _httpParserOnHeaderValueCallback()
 * 5. _httpParserOnHeadersCompleteCallback()
 * 6. _httpParserOnChunkHeaderCallback() (optional only if the response is chunked)
 * 7. _httpParserOnBodyCallback()
 * 8. _httpParserOnChunkCompleteCallback() (optional only if the response is chunked)
 * 9. _httpParserOnMessageCompleteCallback()
 * 
 * Theses states are set in the parser callbacks and used outside the callbacks to determine action.
 * 
 * PARSER_STATE_NONE is assigned to #_httpsResponse_t.parserState when the _httpsResponse_t.parserState is initialized 
 * in @ref IotHttpsClient_InitializeRequest and before parsing a new respone message from the server.
 * 
 * PARSER_STATE_IN_HEADERS is assigned the start of the HTTP Response message. This occurs in the 
 * _httpParserOnMessageBeginCallback(). HTTP headers are always first and there is always the response status line
 * and some headers in a response message acccording to RFC 2616.
 * 
 * PARSER_STATE_HEADERS_COMPLETE is assigned when all of the headers are finished being parsed in the HTTP response
 * message. This occurs in the _httpParserOnHeadersCompleteCallback(). The state can end here if the response has no
 * body, like for a response to a HEAD request. 
 * If this state is not reached, after receiving headers from the network into the user configured header buffer and 
 * running it through the parser, then we know that not all of the headers from the response could fit into the buffer.
 * 
 * PARSER_STATE_IN_BODY is assigned each time the parser reaches HTTP response body. This occurs in the 
 * _httpParserOnBodyCallback().
 * 
 * PARSER_STATE_BODY_COMPLETE is assigned when the parser has finished with the whole HTTP response message. This 
 * happens when _httpParserOnMessageCompleteCallback() is invoked.
 * If this state is not reached, after receiving body from the network into the user configured body buffer and 
 * running it through the parser, then we know that not all of the body from the response could fit into the buffer.

/**
 * @brief The state denoting which buffer (the header buffer or the body buffer) that is currently being processed
 * and for what.
 * 
 * This state is set outside of the parser callbacks and used inside the of parser callbacks to determine actions.
 * 
 * The state moves as follows:
 * Receiving and parsing a response: PROCESSING_STATE_NONE --> PROCESSING_STATE_FILLING_HEADER_BUFFER --> PROCESSING_STATE_FILLING_BODY_BUFFER --> PROCESSING_STATE_FINISHED
 * Searching a response for headers: ((enter state)) --> PROCESSING_STATE_SEARCHING_HEADER_BUFFER --> ((enter state))
 * 
 * PROCESSING_STATE_NONE is assigned when #_httpsResponse_t.bufferProcessingState is being initialize in 
 * @ref IotHttpsClient_InitializeRequest.
 * 
 * PROCESSING_STATE_FILLING_HEADER_BUFFER is assigned at the start of receiving HTTP response headers from the network 
 * into the header buffer, before processing the received headers with the parser. 
 * This state is then used in the parser callbacks _httpParserOnStatusCallback(), _httpParserOnHeaderFieldCallback(), 
 * _httpParserOnHeaderValueCallback(), and _httpParserOnHeadersCompleteCallback() to move the 
 * #_httpsResponse_t.headersCur pointer along in the header buffer.
 * Since the server sends the HTTP response as a single continuous message, somtimes during receiving of the HTTP 
 * headers we may receive part or all of the HTTP response body:
 * ((example header buffer))[headers headers headers headers body body body]
 * When parsing this header buffer the parser will execute _httpParserOnBodyCallback() in the 
 * PROCESSING_STATE_FILLING_HEADER_BUFFER state. The state is used here, for an asynchronous response, to save where
 * and how much body is inside the of the header buffer. When a body buffer becomes available, the body in the header
 * buffer will be copied to the body buffer.
 * 
 * PROCESSING_STATE_FILLING_BODY_BUFFER is assigned at the start of receiving the HTTP response body form the network 
 * into the body buffer, before processing the received body with the parser.
 * 
 * PROCESSING_STATE_FINISHED is assigned at the end of IotHttpsClient_SendSync() or at the end of 
 * IotHttpsClient_SendAsync() when both the header and body buffer are finished being filled with network data and 
 * parsed.
 * 
 * PROCESSING_STATE_SEARCHING_HEADER_BUFFER is assigned in IotHttpsClient_ReadHeader() when searching for a header
 * in the header buffer.
 * This state is used in the parser callback _httpParserOnHeaderFieldCallback() to check if the current header field
 * parsed equals the header we are searching for. It is used in parser callback _httpParserOnHeaderValueCallback() to 
 * return the header value if the corresponding field we are searching for was found. It is used in parser callback 
 * _httpParserOnHeadersCompleteCallback() to stop parsing the header buffer if the header we are searching for was not
 * found.
 * 
 * The header buffer is separate from the body buffer.
 * The header buffer is configured in #IotHttpRequestInfo_t.respUserBuff. The body buffer is configured in 
 * #IotHttpRequestInfo_t.syncInfo->respData or as buffer provided asynchronously during the 
 * #IotHttpsClientCallbacks_t.readReadyCallback() to call to @ref IotHttpsClient_ReadResponseBody().
